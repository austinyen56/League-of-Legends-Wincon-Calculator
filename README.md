Wanna predict if you will win or not in your current game of league? This program will show ur wr and enable you to climb faster (hopefully)

## How to run this program
* You can  run the program using the .exe file presented in the releases, just simply download and double click
* You can also run the python file by ```python3 RitoWinconCalculator.py```
* The given input statements are pretty self explanatory. Please enter champion names all connected and without spaces. Eg: type "Kha' Zix" as "khazix", "Dr. Mundo" as "drmundo"

## What is not considered in this program
Due to the wide variation of possibilities in the game,the following stats are not considered in this program:
* User stats such as current rank, overall WR, champion frequency
* General stats such as winrates from na.op.gg and Asia servers (unable to fetch data due to riot API no longer supports their servers)
* Elo related (smurf queue/ wintrading)
* Off- role/ Off- meta champions or troll matchups
* Summoner spells especially when not used in specific role (ex: JG without smite)
* Other gamemodes such as ARAM or URF
* Inting teamates/ enemies and mentality related occurances
